# EventSource
An `EventSource` is really just a `Signal` where we don't care about its
value, but only when it updates. A prime example is `Mouse.clicks`.

{-| At some point in the future Elm will probably support something like
this:

    type alias EventSource = Signal _

That is, `EventSource` will become an alias for any `Signal a` where we
hide the `a` part.  
Until then, there is the `es` function to create an EventSource

value.

**NB:** Repeated updates to the same value will make the `EventSource`
fire repeatedly.
