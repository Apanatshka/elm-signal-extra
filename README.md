Signal Extra
============

Signal-related, advanced and convenience functions. 

`Signal.Time`
-------------
Sometimes things just move too quickly. You just need to get a grip on
time. This module helps you with that. Well, it helps you with
time-based operations for Elm `Signal`s anyway.

`Signal.Extra`
--------------
Utility functions. Coming soon

`Signal.Discrete`
-----------------
Reacting on events. Coming soon

`Signal.Initial`
----------------
Uninitialised signals. Planned, but no promises

`Signal.Alt`
------------
Alternative signal API based on different primitives. Planned, but no promises
